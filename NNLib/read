cbtest3

Parameters:
in cbtest3 Prototype most functionalities are still not active. Four main parameters need to be selected when the component is loaded, these are "numInputs", "type", "numWeights", and "batch_size", the other parameters dont change anything yet.
Only ANN type works in this component, 6 nodes for hidden layer is maximum 

Inputs:
Target: the target variable you would like to map
input1/2/3/4: the input variable to the neural network
Learning_rate: here the rate at which the neural network learns. I'd suggest adding a slider with a min/max of 0/1e-6, or even 0/1e-8.


FNN42
This is a 4 feature (inputs) 2 output NN with 2 or 1 layers and 1-12 weights per layer. Due to the size of this network, if you see that the training process is 
hectic it is recomended to use maximum weight weights 12 for both hidden layers. Th component does not have any computational parameters and has the following inputs:

x1/2/3/4: Inputs to the NN
L: Number of layers (can either be 2 or 1, due to some technecalities use a float constant, if the float is below 2 it will be a 1 hidden layer NN)
u1/u2: Number of weights in hidden layer 1/2. (use float constant between 1-12)
Lr: Learning rate. (connect to Slider with min/max 0/0.00001)
y1/y2: here give the target variables
lambda 1/2: a constant multiplied by the loss of target 1/2. use float of 1 for both if you would like both targets to be treated equally, incearse one to prioritize that target or decrease other (attach float)
batch_size: The number of iterations before the loss is computed, recomended to keep at 1 (attach float of 1.0)
