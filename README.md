# RTDS Neural Network Models

This is the repository of HVDC/AC electrical grid models for RSCAD/RTDS with NNs. The library relies on HVDC models developed [here](https://github.com/control-protection-grids-tudelft/HVDC-RTDS-models.git).
The repository includes NN models and a user guide on creating and using them in RSCAD/RTDS simulation.
